New website portfolio

I had a previous website design that I felt didn't showcase my abilities.
This repo is for that new design code to live. The portfolio can be found at ~https://luismeza.io~ 

This has been replaced by this repository: https://github.com/lm1435/react-portfolio.

Thank you,

Luis.
